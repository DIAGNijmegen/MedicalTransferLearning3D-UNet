# Transfer learning using 3D U-Net for medical imaging

This repository contains the model used for the paper ''Transfer learning from a sparsely annotated dataset of 3D medical images'' by G. Humpire, C. Jacobs, M. Prokop, B. van Ginneken, N. Lessmann.

## Input

### Input size
The usual input size for a 3D U-Net is `132 x 132 x 132`, this can be defined by setting the parameter `cube_dim` to 132. The full list of allowed `cube_dim` is: 108, 132, 156, and so on. Since the receptive field of the 3D U-Net is 88, the output for an input `132 x 132 x 132` will be `44 x 44 x 44`.

### Image orientation
This network was trained using the image orientation Z, Y, X. We recommend using SimpleITKâ€™s ImageFileReader to read the medical images. Other image orientations may not work as expected.

### Input value range
The input to the network must be within the [-500, 400] Hounsfield Unit range. Values outside that range must be clipped.

## Structure of this repository
- `src/`
  - `notebook.ipynb` Shows how to use the code in this repository.
  - `model_unet3d.py.py` defines the network (`class UNet3DModel`) in Keras.
    - Function `get_3d_unet` loads a randomly initialized 3D U-Net. It receives two parameters, `cube_dim` and `n_classes`. Note that `n_classes` must count in the background class.
  - `pretrained_model.py`:
    - Function `load_sparse_pretrained_3d_unet` gets the network and the weights of the network, which was trained on the sparsely annotated dataset.
  - `kerasmodel_to_onnx.py.py` loads the weights of the 3D U-Net model and transforms the Keras model to ONNX format.
  - `change_num_classes.py` loads the weights of the sparsely trained 3D U-Net (23 classes) into a 3D U-Net with a different number of classes. This script does not initialize the head with random weights, instead, it re-utilizes the weights of the pretrained model.
- `weights/` Contains the weights of the model in keras and ONNX format.
- `DATASOURCES.md` Contains a list of datasets used in our paper.
- `requirements.txt` List of packages and their versions.

## How to use
See `src/notebook.ipynb` for examples of how to execute the code of this repository.

## Index of weights
Follows the list of structures and their corresponding index in the output of the model.

| Index class | Structure |
| -- | -- |
| 0 | Aorta |
| 1 | Bladder |
| 2 | Duodenum |
| 3 | Gallbladder |
| 4 | Heart |
| 5 | Inferior vena cava |
| 6 | Left adrenal gland |
| 7 | Left kidney |
| 8 | Left lung |
| 9 | Left psoas major |
| 10 | Liver |
| 11 | Pancreas |
| 12 | Portal vein and splenic vein |
| 13 | Right adrenal gland |
| 14 | Right kidney |
| 15 | Right lung |
| 16 | Right psoas muscle |
| 17 | Spinal cord |
| 18 | Spleen |
| 19 | Sternum |

| 21 | Trachea |
| 22 | **Background** |

The network was trained using the channels first format, then, the output of the network with batch size one is:

`1 x 23 x cube_dim x cube_dim x cube_dim`

## Compatibility
Please check the file `requirements.txt` to verify the minimum versions of the packages needed to run our scripts.
